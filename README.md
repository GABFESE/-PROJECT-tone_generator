Design a player of monophonic melodies, (equivalent to the tones of telephones such as the NOKIA 1100).

Write a program for the selected microcontroller that does the following.
1. Design a player for monophonic melodies, (equivalent to the tones of telephones such as the NOKIA 1100). The system must be capable of playing up to 5 different melodies. These melodies must be heard through the buzzer or speaker available in the system.
2. The LCD screen should show the name of the melody on the top line and the playback status (Play, Pause and Stop) on the bottom line.
3. Using the 4X4 keyboard, it should be possible to change the playback status, as well as the change of the melody to be played.
4. Each time the microcontroller is turned on, the name of the first piece of music should appear on the LCD screen and the system should allow the user to select the piece to play.
